When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
- When you want to share your code with others or possibly to work between computers.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because there may be changes you are currently working on that could be altered
  that you do not wish to be.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
- branches are just a named commit of a repository, whereas a clone is a copy of a repository.
  Forks are also a copy of a repository but have additional functionality of referencing 
  the original on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
- You will be able to compare differences with your code and merge the desired changes.
