What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- It creates the necessary files to begin commiting your code. Without doing it you will be
  unable to make a commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is where files of your choosing will be put when you `git add` them from your working directory.
  Once they have been committed they will then become a commit snap shot in the repository. The value of this is allowing
  you to see what will be a commit and to make changes as necessary.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- You can review your changes with git diff `--staged` which will compare the staging area to the commit at HEAD.
  If you see there are multiple logical changes you could remove some of the changes so only one is committed at a time.
  I have used Git in the past but this is a valuable lesson I have learned! I tended to lump everything together lol.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- Making an experimental feature or adding a different version branch would be useful for keeping a working version of your orignal code while
  the branch version can be worked on indepent of that.
  
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- I can see the path the commits travel and how they are chained one to the next and when a branch is created how they become a new chain yet
  linked at the commit in which they were created.
